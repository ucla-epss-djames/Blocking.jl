#+TITLE: Blocking.jl
#+AUTHOR: David James, davidabraham@ucla.edu

* Description
  This package performs time series analysis on a set of data. The estimator
  performs a "Blocking Method" to output the mean and standard deviation. For
  more information on the method used refernce:
  Flyvbjerg and Petersen, J. Chem. Phys., 91, 461, 1989

* Usage
  Right now this method needs to be pulled in by Github see the following
  commands:

  #+BEGIN_SRC julia
    # adding the package to your environment
    using Pkg
    Pkg.add("https://github.com/ucla-epss-djames/Blocking.jl")

    # using the package
    using Blocking

    # set of data
    x = rand(1000)

    mn, std = estimate(x)
  #+END_SRC
